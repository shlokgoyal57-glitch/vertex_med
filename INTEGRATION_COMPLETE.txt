#### Modified Files:
1. **src/components/ChatInterface.jsx** (completely refactored)
   - Replaced: Hardcoded sample messages → Real API calls
   - Added: Connection status indicator (green/red badge)
   - Added: Real-time loading/error states
   - Added: Backend health checking on mount
   - Added: Proper error handling with user messages
   - Added: Typing animations during API processing
   - Result: Fully functional chat with real backend

2. **src/components/TrustPanel.jsx** (enhanced)
   - Added: Real API calls to `/api/trust-report`
   - Added: Real agent status from `/api/agents`
   - Added: Auto-refresh every 5 seconds
   - Added: Error handling with fallback defaults
   - Added: Loading spinners
   - Result: Live trust metrics from backend

3. **vite.config.js** (updated)
   - Added: API proxy configuration for development
   - Added: Port forwarding to backend

---

## 🔌 API Endpoints Created

### 4 New REST Endpoints:

1. **GET /api/health**
   - Status: System health check
   - Response: `{"status": "healthy", "service": "Mediguard AI", ...}`
   - Purpose: Frontend uses to detect backend availability

2. **POST /api/query**
   - Request: `{"query": "medical question"}`
   - Response: Messages array with assistant response + drug data
   - Purpose: Core functionality - process medical queries

3. **GET /api/agents**
   - Response: List of all agent statuses
   - Purpose: Display agent processing info

4. **GET /api/trust-report**
   - Response: Trust score + verified claims + hallucinations
   - Purpose: Show safety verification metrics

- View agent processing status
- Handle errors gracefully

### In the Backend:
- Accept medical queries via HTTP
- Process with multi-agent system
- Return structured JSON responses
- Serve API documentation
- Handle concurrent requests
- Fallback on errors

### Between Them:
- CORS-enabled communication
